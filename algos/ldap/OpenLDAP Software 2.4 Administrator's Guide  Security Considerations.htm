<h1>14. Security Considerations</h1>
<p>OpenLDAP Software is designed to run in a wide variety of computing 
environments from tightly-controlled closed networks to the global 
Internet.  Hence, OpenLDAP Software supports many different security 
mechanisms.  This chapter describes these mechanisms and discusses 
security considerations for using OpenLDAP Software.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Network Security">14.1. Network Security</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Selective Listening">14.1.1. Selective Listening</a></h3>
<p>By default, <em>slapd</em>(8) will listen on both the IPv4 and IPv6 "any" addresses.  It is often desirable to have <em>slapd</em> listen on select address/port pairs.  For example, listening only on the IPv4 address <tt>127.0.0.1</tt> will disallow remote access to the directory server. E.g.:</p>
<pre>        slapd -h ldap://127.0.0.1
</pre>
<p>While the server can be configured to listen on a particular 
interface address, this doesn't necessarily restrict access to the 
server to only those networks accessible via that interface.   To 
selective restrict remote access, it is recommend that an <a href="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/security.html#IP%20Firewall">IP Firewall</a> be used to restrict access.</p>
<p>See <sect>Command-line Options</sect> and <em>slapd</em>(8) for more information.</p>
<h3><a name="IP Firewall">14.1.2. IP Firewall</a></h3>
<p><term>IP</term> firewall capabilities of the server system can be 
used to restrict access based upon the client's IP address and/or 
network interface used to communicate with the client.</p>
<p>Generally, <em>slapd</em>(8) listens on port 389/tcp for <a href="ldap://">ldap://</a> sessions and port 636/tcp for <a href="ldaps://">ldaps://</a>) sessions.  <em>slapd</em>(8) may be configured to listen on other ports.</p>
<p>As specifics of how to configure IP firewall are dependent on the 
particular kind of IP firewall used, no examples are provided here. See 
the document associated with your IP firewall.</p>
<h3><a name="TCP Wrappers">14.1.3. TCP Wrappers</a></h3>
<p><em>slapd</em>(8) supports <term>TCP</term> Wrappers.  TCP Wrappers 
provide a rule-based access control system for controlling TCP/IP access
 to the server.  For example, the <em>host_options</em>(5) rule:</p>
<pre>        slapd: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 : ALLOW
        slapd: ALL : DENY
</pre>
<p>allows only incoming connections from the private network <tt>10.0.0.0</tt> and localhost (<tt>127.0.0.1</tt>) to access the directory service.</p>
<p></p><hr align="Left" width="80%">
<strong>Note: </strong>IP addresses are used as <em>slapd</em>(8) is not normally configured to perform reverse lookups.
<hr align="Left" width="80%"><p></p>
<p>It is noted that TCP wrappers require the connection to be accepted. 
As significant processing is required just to deny a connection, it is 
generally advised that IP firewall protection be used instead of TCP 
wrappers.</p>
<p>See <em>hosts_access</em>(5) for more information on TCP wrapper rules.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Data Integrity and Confidentiality Protection">14.2. Data Integrity and Confidentiality Protection</a></h2>
<p><term>Transport Layer Security</term> (TLS) can be used to provide data integrity and confidentiality protection.  OpenLDAP supports negotiation of <term>TLS</term> (<term>SSL</term>) via both StartTLS and <a href="ldaps://">ldaps://</a>. See the <a href="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/tls.html">Using TLS</a> chapter for more information.  StartTLS is the standard track mechanism.</p>
<p>A number of <term>Simple Authentication and Security Layer</term> (SASL) mechanisms, such as <term>DIGEST-MD5</term> and <term>GSSAPI</term>, also provide data integrity and confidentiality protection.  See the <a href="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/sasl.html">Using SASL</a> chapter for more information.</p>
<h3><a name="Security Strength Factors">14.2.1. Security Strength Factors</a></h3>
<p>The server uses <term>Security Strength Factor</term>s (SSF) to 
indicate the relative strength of protection.  A SSF of zero (0) 
indicates no protections are in place.  A SSF of one (1) indicates 
integrity protection are in place.  A SSF greater than one (&gt;1) 
roughly correlates to the effective encryption key length.  For example,
 <term>DES</term> is 56, <term>3DES</term> is 112, and <term>AES</term> 128, 192, or 256.</p>
<p>A number of administrative controls rely on SSFs associated with TLS and SASL protection in place on an LDAP session.</p>
<p><tt>security</tt> controls disallow operations when appropriate protections are not in place.  For example:</p>
<pre>        security ssf=1 update_ssf=112
</pre>
<p>requires integrity protection for all operations and encryption 
protection, 3DES equivalent, for update operations (e.g. add, delete, 
modify, etc.).  See <em>slapd.conf</em>(5) for details.</p>
<p>For fine-grained control, SSFs may be used in access controls. See the <a href="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/access-control.html">Access Control</a> section for more information.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Authentication Methods">14.3. Authentication Methods</a></h2>
<h3><a name="&quot;simple&quot; method">14.3.1. "simple" method</a></h3>
<p>The LDAP "simple" method has three modes of operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>anonymous,
</li><li>unauthenticated, and
</li><li>user/password authenticated.</li></ul>
<p>Anonymous access is requested by providing no name and no password to
 the "simple" bind operation.  Unauthenticated access is requested by 
providing a name but no password.  Authenticated access is requested by 
providing a valid name and password.</p>
<p>An anonymous bind results in an <em>anonymous</em> authorization association.  Anonymous bind mechanism is enabled by default, but can be disabled by specifying "<tt>disallow bind_anon</tt>" in <em>slapd.conf</em>(5).</p>
<p></p><hr align="Left" width="80%">
<strong>Note: </strong>Disabling the anonymous bind mechanism does not 
prevent anonymous access to the directory. To require authentication to 
access the directory, one should instead specify "<tt>require authc</tt>".
<hr align="Left" width="80%"><p></p>
<p>An unauthenticated bind also results in an <em>anonymous</em> authorization association.  Unauthenticated bind mechanism is disabled by default, but can be enabled by specifying "<tt>allow bind_anon_cred</tt>" in <em>slapd.conf</em>(5).
  As a number of LDAP applications mistakenly generate unauthenticated 
bind request when authenticated access was intended (that is, they do 
not ensure a password was provided), this mechanism should generally 
remain disabled.</p>
<p>A successful user/password authenticated bind results in a user 
authorization identity, the provided name, being associated with the 
session.  User/password authenticated bind is enabled by default. 
However, as this mechanism itself offers no eavesdropping protection 
(e.g., the password is set in the clear), it is recommended that it be 
used only in tightly controlled systems or when the LDAP session is 
protected by other means (e.g., TLS, <term>IPsec</term>). Where the 
administrator relies on TLS to protect the password, it is recommended 
that unprotected authentication be disabled.  This is done using the <tt>security</tt> directive's <tt>simple_bind</tt> option, which provides fine grain control over the level of confidential protection to require for <em>simple</em> user/password authentication. E.g., using <tt>security simple_bind=56</tt> would require <em>simple</em> binds to use encryption of DES equivalent or better.</p>
<p>The user/password authenticated bind mechanism can be completely disabled by setting "<tt>disallow bind_simple</tt>".</p>
<p></p><hr align="Left" width="80%">
<strong>Note: </strong>An unsuccessful bind always results in the session having an <em>anonymous</em> authorization association.
<hr align="Left" width="80%"><p></p>
<h3><a name="SASL method">14.3.2. SASL method</a></h3>
<p>The LDAP <term>SASL</term> method allows the use of any SASL authentication mechanism. The <a href="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/sasl.html">Using SASL</a> section discusses the use of SASL.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Password Storage">14.4. Password Storage</a></h2>
<p>LDAP passwords are normally stored in the <em>userPassword</em> attribute. <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4519.txt">RFC4519</a>
 specifies that passwords are not stored in encrypted (or hashed) form. 
 This allows a wide range of password-based authentication mechanisms, 
such as <tt>DIGEST-MD5</tt> to be used. This is also the most interoperable storage scheme.</p>
<p>However, it may be desirable to store a hash of password instead. <em>slapd</em>(8) supports a variety of storage schemes for the administrator to choose from.</p>
<p></p><hr align="Left" width="80%">
<strong>Note: </strong>Values of password attributes, regardless of 
storage scheme used, should be protected as if they were clear text.  
Hashed passwords are subject to <em>dictionary attacks</em> and <em>brute-force attacks</em>.
<hr align="Left" width="80%"><p></p>
<p>The <em>userPassword</em> attribute is allowed to have more than one 
value, and it is possible for each value to be stored in a different 
form. During authentication, <em>slapd</em> will iterate through the 
values until it finds one that matches the offered password or until it 
runs out of values to inspect.  The storage scheme is stored as a prefix
 on the value, so a hashed password using the Salted SHA1 (<tt>SSHA</tt>) scheme looks like:</p>
<pre> userPassword: {SSHA}DkMTwBl+a/3DQTxCYEApdUtNXGgdUac3
</pre>
<p>The advantage of hashed passwords is that an attacker which discovers
 the hash does not have direct access to the actual password. 
Unfortunately, as dictionary and brute force attacks are generally quite
 easy for attackers to successfully mount, this advantage is marginal at
 best (this is why all modern Unix systems use shadow password files).</p>
<p>The disadvantages of hashed storage is that they are non-standard, 
may cause interoperability problem, and generally preclude the use of 
stronger than Simple (or SASL/PLAIN) password-based authentication 
mechanisms such as <tt>DIGEST-MD5</tt>.</p>
<h3><a name="SSHA password storage scheme">14.4.1. SSHA password storage scheme</a></h3>
<p>This is the salted version of the SHA scheme. It is believed to be the most secure password storage scheme supported by <em>slapd</em>.</p>
<p>These values represent the same password:</p>
<pre> userPassword: {SSHA}DkMTwBl+a/3DQTxCYEApdUtNXGgdUac3
 userPassword: {SSHA}d0Q0626PSH9VUld7yWpR0k6BlpQmtczb
</pre>
<h3><a name="CRYPT password storage scheme">14.4.2. CRYPT password storage scheme</a></h3>
<p>This scheme uses the operating system's <em>crypt(3)</em> hash function. It normally produces the traditional Unix-style 13 character hash, but on systems with <tt>glibc2</tt> it can also generate the more secure 34-byte MD5 hash.</p>
<pre> userPassword: {CRYPT}aUihad99hmev6
 userPassword: {CRYPT}$1$czBJdDqS$TmkzUAb836oMxg/BmIwN.1
</pre>
<p>The advantage of the CRYPT scheme is that passwords can be 
transferred to or from an existing Unix password file without having to 
know the cleartext form. Both forms of <em>crypt</em> include salt so they have some resistance to dictionary attacks.</p>
<p></p><hr align="Left" width="80%">
<strong>Note: </strong>Since this scheme uses the operating system's <em>crypt(3)</em> hash function, it is therefore operating system specific.
<hr align="Left" width="80%"><p></p>
<h3><a name="MD5 password storage scheme">14.4.3. MD5 password storage scheme</a></h3>
<p>This scheme simply takes the MD5 hash of the password and stores it in base64 encoded form:</p>
<pre> userPassword: {MD5}Xr4ilOzQ4PCOq3aQ0qbuaQ==
</pre>
<p>Although safer than cleartext storage, this is not a very secure 
scheme. The MD5 algorithm is fast, and because there is no salt the 
scheme is vulnerable to a dictionary attack.</p>
<h3><a name="SMD5 password storage scheme">14.4.4. SMD5 password storage scheme</a></h3>
<p>This improves on the basic MD5 scheme by adding salt (random data 
which means that there are many possible representations of a given 
plaintext password). For example, both of these values represent the 
same password:</p>
<pre> userPassword: {SMD5}4QWGWZpj9GCmfuqEvm8HtZhZS6E=
 userPassword: {SMD5}g2/J/7D5EO6+oPdklp5p8YtNFk4=
</pre>
<h3><a name="SHA password storage scheme">14.4.5. SHA password storage scheme</a></h3>
<p>Like the MD5 scheme, this simply feeds the password through an SHA 
hash process. SHA is thought to be more secure than MD5, but the lack of
 salt leaves the scheme exposed to dictionary attacks.</p>
<pre> userPassword: {SHA}5en6G6MezRroT3XKqkdPOmY/BfQ=
</pre>
<h3><a name="SASL password storage scheme">14.4.6. SASL password storage scheme</a></h3>
<p>This is not really a password storage scheme at all. It uses the value of the <em>userPassword</em> attribute to delegate password verification to another process. See below for more information.</p>
<p></p><hr align="Left" width="80%">
<strong>Note: </strong>This is not the same as using SASL to authenticate the LDAP session.
<hr align="Left" width="80%"><p></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Pass-Through authentication">14.5. Pass-Through authentication</a></h2>
<p>Since OpenLDAP 2.0 <em>slapd</em> has had the ability to delegate password verification to a separate process. This uses the <em>sasl_checkpass(3)</em>
 function so it can use any back-end server that Cyrus SASL supports for
 checking passwords. The choice is very wide, as one option is to use <em>saslauthd(8)</em> which in turn can use local files, Kerberos, an IMAP server, another LDAP server, or anything supported by the PAM mechanism.</p>
<p>The server must be built with the <tt>--enable-spasswd</tt> configuration option to enable pass-through authentication.</p>
<p></p><hr align="Left" width="80%">
<strong>Note: </strong>This is not the same as using a SASL mechanism to authenticate the LDAP session.
<hr align="Left" width="80%"><p></p>
<p>Pass-Through authentication works only with plaintext passwords, as 
used in the "simple bind" and "SASL PLAIN" authentication mechanisms.}}</p>
<p>Pass-Through authentication is selective: it only affects users whose <em>userPassword</em> attribute has a value marked with the "{SASL}" scheme. The format of the attribute is:</p>
<pre> userPassword: {SASL}username@realm
</pre>
<p>The <em>username</em> and <em>realm</em> are passed to the SASL 
authentication mechanism and are used to identify the account whose 
password is to be verified. This allows arbitrary mapping between 
entries in OpenLDAP and accounts known to the backend authentication 
service.</p>
<p>It would be wise to use access control to prevent users from changing
 their passwords through LDAP where they have pass-through 
authentication enabled.</p>
<h3><a name="Configuring slapd to use an authentication provider">14.5.1. Configuring slapd to use an authentication provider</a></h3>
<p>Where an entry has a "{SASL}" password value, OpenLDAP delegates the 
whole process of validating that entry's password to Cyrus SASL. All the
 configuration is therefore done in SASL config files.</p>
<p>The first file to be considered is confusingly named <em>slapd.conf</em> and is typically found in the SASL library directory, often <tt>/usr/lib/sasl2/slapd.conf</tt> This file governs the use of SASL when talking LDAP to <em>slapd</em> as well as the use of SASL backends for pass-through authentication. See <tt>options.html</tt> in the <a href="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html">Cyrus SASL</a> docs for full details. Here is a simple example for a server that will use <em>saslauthd</em> to verify passwords:</p>
<pre> mech_list: plain
 pwcheck_method: saslauthd
 saslauthd_path: /var/run/sasl2/mux
</pre>
<h3><a name="Configuring saslauthd">14.5.2. Configuring saslauthd</a></h3>
<p><em>saslauthd</em> is capable of using many different authentication services: see <em>saslauthd(8)</em> for details. A common requirement is to delegate some or all authentication to another LDAP server. Here is a sample <tt>saslauthd.conf</tt> that uses Microsoft Active Directory (AD):</p>
<pre> ldap_servers: ldap://dc1.example.com/ ldap://dc2.example.com/

 ldap_search_base: cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com
 ldap_filter: (userPrincipalName=%u)

 ldap_bind_dn: cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com
 ldap_password: secret
</pre>
<p>In this case, <em>saslauthd</em> is run with the <tt>ldap</tt> authentication mechanism and is set to combine the SASL realm with the login name:</p>
<pre> saslauthd -a ldap -r
</pre>
<p>This means that the "username@realm" string from the <em>userPassword</em>
 attribute ends up being used to search AD for 
"userPrincipalName=username@realm" - the password is then verified by 
attempting to bind to AD using the entry found by the search and the 
password supplied by the LDAP client.</p>
<h3><a name="Testing pass-through authentication">14.5.3. Testing pass-through authentication</a></h3>
<p>It is usually best to start with the back-end authentication provider and work through <em>saslauthd</em> and <em>slapd</em> towards the LDAP client.</p>
<p>In the AD example above, first check that the DN and password that <em>saslauthd</em> will use when it connects to AD are valid:</p>
<pre> ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
      -D cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -w secret \
      -b '' \
      -s base
</pre>
<p>Next check that a sample AD user can be found:</p>
<pre> ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
      -D cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -w secret \
      -b cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      "(userPrincipalName=user@ad.example.com)"
</pre>
<p>Check that the user can bind to AD:</p>
<pre> ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
      -D cn=user,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -w userpassword \
      -b cn=user,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -s base \
        "(objectclass=*)"
</pre>
<p>If all that works then <em>saslauthd</em> should be able to do the same:</p>
<pre> testsaslauthd -u user@ad.example.com -p userpassword
 testsaslauthd -u user@ad.example.com -p wrongpassword
</pre>
<p>Now put the magic token into an entry in OpenLDAP:</p>
<pre> userPassword: {SASL}user@ad.example.com
</pre>
<p>It should now be possible to bind to OpenLDAP using the DN of that entry and the password of the AD user.</p>
