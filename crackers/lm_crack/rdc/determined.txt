I visited my GP in September 2013 and explained to him I was depressed, had an alcohol problem and needed help.
Because I was on medical card at the time, he referred me to Donegal Mental Health Services.
I first met with Nurse Jacinta Kelly who assessed me and then referred me to Doctor Dermot Ward and Nurse Sarah McCardle.
Doctor Ward initially agreed to to refer me to psychologist but then changed his mind one week after I agreed to one
to one counselling with Nurse Sarah McCardle.

When I received letter notifying cancellation of my referral to psychologist, I was unhappy and expressed this to Nurse McCardle.

sub esp, 4                ; subtract 4 from esp
push ebx                  ; subtract 4 from esp
mov ebx, esp              ; move esp-8 into ebx
add ebx, 4                ; add 4 to esp
add ebx, 4                ; add 4 to esp
xchg dword ptr [esp], ebx ; exchange ebx with [esp]
pop esp                   ; esp returned to normal
